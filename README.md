# DeAI-Week-2

## Details
Runs using a .env.local file containing OPENAI_API_KEY = XXXXX in the project root folder.

Weekend Project
To consolidate the knowledge acquired this week, students should complete the following project:

Create a GitHub repository for your project

Add all members of your group as collaborators

Create a README.md file with a description of your project

Create a new application from scratch using NextJS

Develop a page for generating jokes using AI

Add a feature for users to customize the Joke Parameters

Choose which parameters you'd like to offer your users
For example, allow users to select:
A topic from a list of options (work, people, animals, food, television, etc.)
A tone for the joke (witty, sarcastic, silly, dark, goofy, etc.)
The type of joke (pun, knock-knock, story, etc.)
The "temperature" (how much randomness/creativity to add to the joke)
Consider how you'll construct the prompt for the AI model to adhere to these parameters
After configuring the parameters, users should click a button to generate the joke, and the generated response must be displayed on the user's screen within the same page

Add a feature for the AI to evaluate if the generated jokes are "funny", "appropriate", "offensive", or other criteria you deem important

Experiment with different prompts and system instructions to optimize generalist AI models for "subjective" classification tasks like humor, appropriateness, offensiveness, etc.

Submit your project via the submission form
